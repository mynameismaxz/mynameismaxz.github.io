Hello! This post is my first blog entry after being away for quite some time. It's not that I haven't been writing blogs, but I've been writing on various platforms such as [Medium](https://medium.com/@mynameismaxz) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/bigb0ssjaaaaa), among others. As a result, some of my posts accumulated, and I didn't have the time to write them regularly. Therefore, I decided that it's time to have my own blog to store the information I've studied, in case visitors might find new ideas or perspectives to share. Additionally, it serves as a place to document various memories that tend to fade over time.

The blog I'm creating here will be built on the Hugo framework, currently in its first version (and I hope there will be subsequent versions). The convenience is that I can write posts in **Markdown**, and it can support **two** languages (which I will attempt to translate into English from now on).

To those who are reading this blog post, thank you once again, and see you in the upcoming blog posts! ðŸ‘‹
